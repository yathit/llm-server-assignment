# LLM Chat Server

Features:

1. CRUD conversations that contain a history of queries and responses from an LLM (OpenAI GPT 3-turbo).
2. Send prompt queries and receive responses from the LLM. 
3. Prompts need to contain the existing conversation history as context.
4. All prompts sent to the LLMs and the responses returned need to be anonymized and stored in a database for auditing purposes.
